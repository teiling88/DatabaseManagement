Installation of MyWebSQL is pretty straightforward.
---------------------------------------------------

1. Extract all files inside the archive into any folder of your choice.

   can create a new virtual alias/host if your webserver allows you to do that.

3. [optional] In your browser, navigate to 'install.php' to check for the PHP installation and settings
	to make sure MyWebSQL will run on your server without problems.

4. [optional] Open the file servers.php inside the "config" folder. Review and change/add
   additional servers information in the file.

Software Updates
--------------------------------------------------

- By default an update check runs for new releases every Monday when MyWebSQL is used for first time.
  You can disable this check by modifying 'updates.php' file in the config folder.
- You can use the built-in update check functionality in the main application menu to see if a new
  version is available.
