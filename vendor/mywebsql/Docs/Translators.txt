Guidelines for Translators
---------------------------------------------------

1. All translation for one particular language is present in one file inside the 'lang' folder.

2. The language code in filename represents the language to be used in the file. A list of the codes
	and associated language is present in the file 'config/lang.php' for lookup.

3. Since the language file is php code itself, you should only change the english sentences and words
	and avoid changing any php code in the file.
	
4. Each line of text contains the english word/sentence, followed by '=>' and then the translated text.
	This should be useful for the translator so that both the english and translated text are available
	for review side by side during editing. You should ONLY CHANGE THE SECOND text on the line and leave
	the first one intact in English. Alternatively, translate the text that is surrounded by double quotes (""),
	and leave the text as is which is inside single quotes ('').

5. Before submitting the finalized translation, please review the change once to make sure everything is
	correctly translated. We will take care of the rest.
	
Please mention your contact information when submitting the translation, and whether you are available for
further updates to the language (when new text is added or existing updated)
